People with confidence walk quickly. They have places to go, people to see, or important work to do. Even if you aren't in a hurry, you can increase your self-confidence by putting some energy in your step.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\" class=\"qidline\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>*&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\" class=\"qidline\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best ways to build confidence is listening to an inspiring speech.

In fact, half of the 6,000-7,000 languages spoken around the world today will likely die out by the next century, according to the United Nations zxxkEducational , Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). &nbsp; In an effort to prevent language loss, scholars from a number of organizations _UNESCO and National Geographic among them—have for many years been documenting dying languages and the cultures they reflect. &nbsp;Mark Turin, a scientist at the Macmillan Centre Yale University, who specializes in the languages and &nbsp;oral traditions of the Himalayas, is following in that tradition. His recently published book, A Grammar of Thangmi with an Ethnolinguistic Introduction to the Speakers and zxxkTheir Culture, grows out of his experience living, working, and raising a family in a village in Nepal. &nbsp;Documenting the Thangmi language and culture is just a starting point for Turin, who seeks to include other languages and oral traditions across the Himalayan reaches of India , Nepal, Bhutan, and China . But he is not content to simply record these voices before they disappear without record. &nbsp; At the University of Cambridge Turin discovered a wealth of important materials-including photographs, films, tape recordings, and field notes—which had remained unstudied and were badly in need of care and protection. &nbsp;Now, through the two organizations that he has founded –the Digital Himalaya Project and the World Oral Literature Project __Turin has started a campaign to make suchzxxk documents, for the world available not just to scholars but to the younger generations of communities from whom the materials were originally collected. Thanks to digital technology and the widely available Internet, Turin notes, the endangered languages can be saved and reconnected with speech communities.</p>",
